  Hey there! I'm glad you're here :)

I am a Fraud-Risk analyst and I live in Gurgaon, India. In my free time I love to meddle with R and pretty much any data I can get my hands on, as I'm sure you surmised from this site. Time I don't spend hunched over my laptop, I spend in reading, watching films and scratching away on my violin. And every so often, I like to put a bag on my back and take a map in my hand and go rambling around a new country.

If you've been around the site and want to say something, I'd love to hear from you - even if it's just a hello :)
